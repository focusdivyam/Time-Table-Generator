# Time-Table-Generator
An algorithm that generates a time table using a SAT solver under specific constraints.

1. CONSTRAINTS-
   
	->Classes should run only from Monday to Friday(available days).
	
	->Only 1 lecture of any course on a single day.
	
	->Classes should be in institute specified timings.
	
	->Labs should be continuous on a day.
	
	->No clashes are there for rooms or profs .

2. Main highlights:
   
a) Input:
	A list of students representing the courses chosen by a specific student.
	
	Course info of every course i.e. course id, professor teaching the course, and structure of that course (L-T-P).
	
	A list of available rooms with their respective capacity.
	
	Finally, the institute class/work timings.

b) Output:
	Weekly Schedule for the given courses as per their structure(L-T-P) to a .csv file. 
	
	Clearly mentioning the time slots and room booked for every course without any clashes.

3. TECH USED-
	Used python as it is versatile and readable.
	
	Z3 â€“SAT solver for checking if the given problem is sat or unsat based upon constraints.

4. Output:
	User can choose to see whole time table or batch specific time table by entering their batch.
	
	The algorithm prints the time table accordingly and clearly represents the:

	 -Day of class
 
	-Room allocated to course
 
	- Course ID and
 
 	- Prof.  Teaching the course.

5. For running:
	Clone the repository to a folder in your local machine and download pyhton z3 sat solver to the same folder and open it in terminal.

	Type 'python main.py' in terminal to generate the time table.
